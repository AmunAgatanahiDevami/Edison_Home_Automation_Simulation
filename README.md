For the BLE I am using Bleno which is apart of the NPM package. Be sure to install the module " npm install bleno" 




For this simulation project the components I am using are : 5x Grove Button v1.1 , 1x Grove RGB LCD Screen (JHD1313M1), 1x Grove Shield, 1x Logitech C270 Webcam, 1x Smartphone (Android 5.1 or higher), 1x Asus Zenwatch 2.
